Solve the 24-point puzzle. You are given three numbers: 7, 8 and 9. Perform two steps as follows:
Choose two numbers and use one of the four arithmetic operations to replace the two numbers with the result you get.
The final claim should be 24.

Please solve this problem step by step.
Remember you need to have a summary in the last line of your reply: [a1, a2, a3] -> (operation) -> [b1, b2] -> (operation) -> [c1]
For example, [2, 3, 6] get 24, your last line may be: [2, 3, 6] -> (2 + 6 = 8) -> [3, 8] -> (3 * 8 = 24) -> [24]
