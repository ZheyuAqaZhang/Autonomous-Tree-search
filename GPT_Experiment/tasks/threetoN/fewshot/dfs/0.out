Step 1
[0 / 12, 0 / 18] -> (fill the first) [12 / 12, 0 / 18]

Step 2
[12 / 12, 0 / 18] -> (pour the first to the second) [0 / 12, 12 / 18]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [12 / 12, 0 / 18].

Step 2 (revised)
[12 / 12, 0 / 18] -> (empty the first) [0 / 12, 0 / 18]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [12 / 12, 0 / 18].

Let's step back. Now it is [0 / 12, 0 / 18].

Step 1 (revised)
[0 / 12, 0 / 18] -> (fill the second) [0 / 12, 18 / 18]

Step 2 (revised)
[0 / 12, 18 / 18] -> (pour the second to the first) [12 / 12, 6 / 18]

Summary: [0 / 12, 0 / 18] -> [0 / 12, 18 / 18] -> [12 / 12, 6 / 18]
