Step 1
[1, 1, 7] -> (1 + 1 = 2) [2, 7]

Step 2
[1, 1, 7] -> [2, 7] -> (2 + 7 = 9) [9]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [2, 7].

Step 2 (revised)
[1, 1, 7] -> [2, 7] -> (2 * 7 = 14) [14]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [2, 7].

Let's step back. Now it is [1, 1, 7].

Step 1 (revised)
[1, 1, 7] -> (1 * 7 = 7) [7, 1]

Step 2 (revised)
[1, 1, 7] -> [7, 1] -> (7 + 1 = 8) [8]

Summary: [1, 1, 7] -> (1 * 7 = 7) -> [7, 1] -> (7 + 1 = 8) -> [8]
