Step 1
[X=0, Y=0] -> (7=1*7) [X=1, Y=7]

Step 2
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]-> (2=1*2) [X=2, Y=9]

Step 3
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]->[X=2, Y=9]-> (5=1*5) [X=3, Y=14]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [X=2, Y=9].

Step 3 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]->[X=2, Y=9]-> (5=5*1) [X=7, Y=10]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [X=2, Y=9].

Let's step back. Now it is [X=1, Y=7].

Step 2 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]-> (2=2*1) [X=3, Y=8]

Step 3 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]->[X=3, Y=8]-> (5=1*5) [X=4, Y=13]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [X=3, Y=8].

Step 3 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=1, Y=7]->[X=3, Y=8]-> (5=5*1) [X=8, Y=9]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [X=3, Y=8].

Let's step back. Now it is [X=1, Y=7].

Let's step back. Now it is [X=0, Y=0].

Step 1 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0] -> (7=7*1) [X=7, Y=1]

Step 2 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=7, Y=1]-> (2=2*1) [X=9, Y=2]

Step 3 (revised)
[X=0, Y=0]->[X=7, Y=1]->[X=9, Y=2]-> (5=5*1) [X=14, Y=3]

Finally, we calculate X*Y:
[X=14, Y=3] -> 42

Summary: ans=42.
