Step 1
[0 / 11, 0 / 25] -> (fill the first) [11 / 11, 0 / 25]

Step 2
[11 / 11, 0 / 25] -> (pour the first to the second) [0 / 11, 11 / 25]

Step 3
[0 / 11, 11 / 25] -> (fill the first) [11 / 11, 11 / 25]

Step 4
[11 / 11, 11 / 25] -> (pour the first to the second) [0 / 11, 22 / 25]

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is [11 / 11, 11 / 25].

Step 4 (revised)
[11 / 11, 11 / 25] -> (empty the second) [11 / 11, 0 / 25]
