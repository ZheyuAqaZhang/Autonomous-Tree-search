Step 1
[0 / 7, 0 / 29] -> (fill the first) [7 / 7, 0 / 29]

Step 2
[7 / 7, 0 / 29] -> (pour the first to the second) [0 / 7, 7 / 29]

Step 3
[0 / 7, 7 / 29] -> (fill the first) [7 / 7, 7 / 29]

Step 4
[7 / 7, 7 / 29] -> (pour the first to the second) [0 / 7, 14 / 29]

Summary: [0 / 7, 0 / 29] -> [7 / 7, 0 / 29] -> [0 / 7, 7 / 29] -> [7 / 7, 7 / 29] -> [0 / 7, 14 / 29] (14 is the goal)
