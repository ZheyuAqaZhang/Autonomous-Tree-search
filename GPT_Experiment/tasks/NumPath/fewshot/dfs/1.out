Let's start with the number 10 and apply the operations to reach 81 in 4 steps.

Step 1
10 -> (op1) 20

Step 2
10 -> 20 -> (op2) 21

Step 3
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> (op1) 42

Step 4
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> 42 -> (op2) 43

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is 42.

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> 42 -> (op1) 84

This is not the goal and it's more than 81. Let's step back. Now it is 42.

Let's step back. Now it is 21.

Step 3 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> (op2) 22

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> 22 -> (op1) 44

This is not the goal and it's more than 81. Let's step back. Now it is 22.

Let's step back. Now it is 21.

Let's step back. Now it is 20.

Step 2 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> (op1) 40

Step 3 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> (op2) 41

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 41 -> (op1) 82

This is not the goal and it's more than 81. Let's step back. Now it is 41.

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 41 -> (op2) 42

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is 41.

Let's step back. Now it is 40.

Let's step back. Now it is 20.

Step 2 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> (op2) 21

Step 3 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> (op1) 42

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> 42 -> (op1) 84

This is not the goal and it's more than 81. Let's step back. Now it is 42.

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 21 -> 42 -> (op2) 43

This is not the goal. Let's step back. Now it is 42.

Let's step back. Now it is 21.

Let's step back. Now it is 20.

Step 2 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> (op1) 40

Step 3 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> (op1) 80

Step 4 (revised)
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 80 -> (op2) 81

Finally, we have reached the goal. The sequence of operations is: 10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 80 -> 81.
